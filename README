Codemancer

Pre-release version
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction

  Codemancer is ultimately intended to be an Open Source interactive
  disassembler for reverse engineering of executable code. Planned
  features include:

  - support for multiple instruction set architectures by means of an
    XML-based description language;
  - a database for recording information about the behaviour and purpose
    of code which has been disassembled;
  - an inference engine for augmenting the content of the database; and
  - an interactive front end for the user to supply information which
    cannot be deduced automatically.

  Since these goals will likely take several years to realise, features
  will be released incrementally as they are developed.

Current status

  Disassembler

  - plain disassembly: working
  - semantic modelling: working, but accessible only via API
  - control flow analysis: not started
  - data flow analysis: not started
  - interactive user interface: not started

  Architectures

  - 6502: complete, but not including variants such as the 65C02
  - z80: incomplete
  - more to follow

  Object file formats:

  - ELF: working, but no relocations
  - COFF: working, but no relocations
  - AOF: working, but no relocations
  - more to follow
  - integration with disassembler: not started

Building Codemancer

  The source code can be checked out from the public repository using git:

    git clone git://codemancer.org/codemancer.git

  The result will be placed in a newly-created directory named 'codemancer'.
  Subsequent changes can be fetched using the git pull command from within
  that directory:

    git pull

  To build the code you will need the following:

  - Java (tested with OpenJDK 6)
  - Ant (tested with version 1.7.1)

  Executing the 'ant' command with no arguments will build the default
  target, which is the Codemancer jar file:

    ant

  This is written to the pathname build/jar/codemancer.jar. You can
  additionally run the automated tests by building the 'test' target:

    ant test

Running Codemancer

  To use the jar file it must be listed on the CLASSPATH:

    export CLASSPATH=build/jar/codemancer.jar

  The class org.codemancer.Disassemble is provided to demonstrate the
  ability to disassemble a raw binary file. It can be invoked from the
  command line as follows:

    java org.codemancer.Disassemble <architecture> <pathname>

  for example:

    java org.codemancer.Disassemble 6502 image.bin

  The resulting assembly language listing is written to stdout.

Interface stability

  Neither the API nor the markup language should be considered stable
  at present. It is intended that both should become stable, but the
  current rate of change is such that this would seriously hamper
  progress if attempted now.

Limitations

  Whilst the disassembler is now technically usable, taken at face value
  its current capabilities are neither novel nor conspicuously useful.
  However, it does demonstrate that a real CPU architecture can be
  described using a relatively small set of generic primitives.

  Specific known limitations at present include the following:

  - Status flags are not properly supported.
  - There is no easy way to handle registers which are part of larger
    registers.
  - There will be a need to support register bitmaps, for example as
    used by ARM LDM and STM instructions.
  - There will be a need to support instruction prefixes, for example
    as used by the x86 family and to a lesser extent the Z80.
